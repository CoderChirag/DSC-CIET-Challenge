            ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years
    before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and
    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
    thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
    life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers,
    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

            ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress
    which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
    to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
    developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
    attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

        <div class="content">
          ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
    theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
